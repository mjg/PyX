3d graphs

3d graphs are created by graphxyz instances. They behave quite similar to
regular graphs. Various styles can be used on 3d graphs without further
adjustment like the symbol, line, and errorbar styles. Beside that the
surface and grid styles are available to handle 3d data defined on a
rectangular grid.
