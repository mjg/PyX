Stroking the grid

The grid as its created by PyX internally can also be stroked by means of the
grid style. In this example the minimal value of the z axis was changed too. As
lines are cut at graph boundaries properly, this results in a cutted grid. ...

! The surface style does not support cuts at the graph boundary. It'll always
skip rectangles partially (or fully) outside of the graph.
