Using image instances from the PIL

You can use image instances from the [Python Image Library
http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil] to create bitmaps. You then have an
easy access to all the bitmap formats available in PIL, you may also use PIL
features to create/load/modify bitmaps etc. ... In order to create an image
pixel by pixel, the PIL is not necessary (by the way, it is slow to use
putpixel for that).

!! Using PIL image instances you can also pass indexed images
to PyX's `bitmap` class.
