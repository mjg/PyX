Texter

Texters create the label strings written to the ticks. There are texters
available for decimal numbers without and with an exponential part as well as
fractions. ...

! At the right axis we also show how to create a special piaxis. Here some axis
parameters are altered to fit an pi-scaled axis nicely. Futhermore instead of
just creating a special axis instance by setting the divisor and texter
parameters, a `piaxis` class is created which just alters the defaults of the
linear axis it is based at.
