Painting of an axis

Axis painters performs the painting of an axis, which means they take all the
information of the axis an create a proper drawing for that. ...

While an usual axis painter has quite some parameters to adjust the output,
here we only alter the ticks. By default, ticks are stroked only towards the
inside of the graph (in the path examples there is no graph but don't mind).
The labels and the axis title are plotted outside of the graph. Futhermore the
axis title (when present as in this example) is rotated along the axis (without
writing it upside down), while the tick labels are not rotated at all.

In this example we set an `outerticklength`. Together with the
`innerticklength` set to the same value by default the ticks are stroked across
the axis. As it is common to sub-components of the axis, you need to pass the
adapted instances (stored in the variable `mypainter` here) to the axis in its
constructor.
