Logarithmic axes

Logarithmic axes are quite similar to linear axes and differ only in a very few
properties, namely the non-linear convert method in which they transform values
to positions on the axis, a different default partitioner and a different
default rater. ... While the partitioner really is quite different - it implements
a logarithmic positioning of the ticks - the rater just alters some defaults in
favour of using more subticks to improve the visualization of the logarithmic
nature of the axis.

! Beside presenting a standard logarithmic axis we also show you how to alter
the base used by the logarithmic axis. Since the functionality of a logarithmic
axis is independend of the base, all we need to adjust are certain components
creating ticks, the texts for the labels etc.
