Manual parters and rational number arithmetics

Partitioners (in the code the short form `parter` is used all over the place)
take care of calculating appropriate tick positions for a given axis range.
Automatic partitioners create several tick lists, which are than rated by an
axis rater instance afterwards. In contrast manual partitioners create a single
tick list only, which thus doesn't need to be rated at all. ...

In this example we create a manual partitioner, which places ticks with a
distance of 1/3 and subticks with a distance of 1/6. We than use this
partitioner at two axis, which are identical except for a texter instance to
show you another feature of the axes in PyX, namely the rational number
arithmetics used to place ticks. The rational numbers are preserved throughout
the whole process of merging ticks, until the texter finally needs to output
the rational numbers. And at the very end the decimal texter steps into the
problem to create a proper representation for the frations. The solution is
shown at the left part of the example: the texter marks a period to express the
fraction.

Alternatively you can use the rational texter to display the values by
fractions directly.
