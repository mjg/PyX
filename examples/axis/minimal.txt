Minimal example drawing an axis along a path

This is the basic example how to draw an axis along an arbitrary path. The
function `pathaxis` from the `graph.axis` module takes a path and returns a
canvas. ... As opposed to the typical usecase in graphs, we must fix the axis
range by appropriate `min` and `max` arguments, because no data is provided to
the axis instance where a data range could be extracted from. In graphs the
range of an axis gets adjusted automatically although you can still set minimal
and/or maximal values to force a certain axis range.

The axis instance is passed as the second argument to the `pathaxis` function.
To use the axis at a graph all you need to do is to path the instance to the
axis constructor using an appropriate keyword specifying the axis name.
