Basic plotting

One of PyX's major strengths are its graph-plotting capabilities. PyX offers
you a flexible system which, while providing sensible defaults, allows you to
customize almost every aspect of the graph output. Such a flexibility comes at
a price, though: you need to learn at least a little bit about the different
components playing together in order to produce a graph. In this section, we
try to give you a gentle introduction to one component after the other by by
demonstrating how to plot various kind of data (from a file, a function mapping
x values to y values, a parametric function). Furthermore, we explain
how to do simple modifications to the axes of the graph and show how to add
a graph key. 

After having gone through the introductory examples you should be able to
freely go through the following sections of the examples, which examples will
be devoted to a more detailed explanation of PyX's graph-plotting facilities.
In particular, you might want to learn about the customization of the graph
axes (see section [ Graph axes ../axis/index.html]), about further available
graph styles (see section [Graph styles ../styles/index.html]) and about
bar graphs (see section [Bar graphs ../bargraphs/index.html]).
