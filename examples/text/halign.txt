Horizontal alignment

The example shows the result of the different text attributes for horizontal
alignment. We first need to emphasize, that PyX distinguishes between the
alignment of the text box and the alignment of the material within the text
box. The first line in the output shows the effect of the box alignment
created by `boxleft`, `boxcenter` and `boxright` leading to left, center, and right
alignment of the text box with respect to the dotted lines. ...

The middle part shows the examples for centering a box, but aligning the
content differently inside the box, namely at the left box boundary by
`flushleft`, at the center by `flushcenter` and at the right box boundary by
`flushright`. Note, that such an alignment of material is available only
when you create a parbox in TeX. This is easily done by means of the `parbox`
attribute, where you have to specify the width of the box.

At the bottom, you can see combinations of `boxleft` and `flushleft`, `boxcenter` and
`flushcenter`, and `boxright` and `boxcenter` in action. These combinations are
available by the attributes `left`, `center` and `right` to shortcut the setting of
both corresponding attributes. You can use these shortcuts for box alignment as
well, when you do not create a parbox.

!! Note that the alignment features are implemented in such a way, that they work
in both, TeX and LaTeX mode. Furthermore, you can always influence the
alignment of the box contents by appropriate TeX and LaTeX commands as well.
