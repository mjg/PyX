Creating text

One of the major features of PyX is to use the TeX typesetting engine to create
text. PyX will start a single TeX or LaTeX instance as soon as text needs to be
typeset. It passes the texts to this instance and directly reads the typeset
information (dvi file) as created by the TeX interpreter. By this seamless and
as far as we know unique integration, all advanced features of the TeX
typesetting system like its high quality paragraph builder or the highly
advanced math mode become available to PyX users.
