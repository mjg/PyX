Minimal split-axis example

This minimal example creates a split-axis by two simple modifications. ...
First a splitaxis instance is passed to the graph constructor and secondly the
data provided for this axis is modified to contain a tuple of two items. The
first item is used as a dictionary key to identify the subaxis, to which the
presented data belongs to. The second item in the tuple is used as the value on
this subaxis.
