Define a graph style with a translatable canvas.

! This example shows how to define a graph style with a translatable canvas. ...
With the ordinary symbol graph style, the symbol is drawn each time it is used.
Correspondingly, the output size scales with the number of times the symbol is
used. The code in this example shows how one can easily define a graph style
which uses a translatable canvas on which the symbol is drawn once and then
reused multiple times. For the EPS output, this reduces the file from 104kB to
47kB (large taken up by the fonts), for the PDF output from 238kB to 20kB.
