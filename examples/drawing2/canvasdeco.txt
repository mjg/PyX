Inserting a canvas as a path decoration

In this example, a decoration is constructed using an arbitrary canvas (here
`cd`). This canvas decoration is then inserted, i.e. the path is decorated by
inserting the canvas at several positions.

The canvas is inserted with its origin lined up with the point on the path, and
possibly rotated by a fixed angle or relative to the path tangent (as in the
example).

For convenience, additional canvas attributes can be specified on the fly.
