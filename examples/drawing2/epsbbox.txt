EPS-file inclusion and bounding boxes

In this example we first generate an EPS-file and write it out.
Reading an EPS-file with `epsfile.epsfile()` gives you a canvas which can be
inserted just like other canvases. Note how you can scale the EPS when it is read.

Like many others, PyX writes out high resolution bounding boxes.
By default it reads the normal bounding boxes, but using `hiresbbox=1` you can
instruct PyX to use the high resolution version. Note the difference between the
middle (low res bbox) and right (high res bbox) boxes.

!The difference between left (canvas bbox) and right (high res eps bbox) is due to
fact that PyX can take into account the width of the line only for the bounding
box calculation during the output of the EPS.
