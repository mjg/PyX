Stack bars on top of each other

To stack bars on top of each other, you can add stackedbarpos styles and
further bars to the list of styles. ... The stackbarpos need to get different
column names each time to access the new stack data. This example also adds
text styles to the bars, which just repeat the value column data here, but they
could refer to other columns as well.
