So, here's a patch trying to combine the existing reasoning for pos with the
possibility to position arrow heads like other decorations.

It goes on top of "fix arrows at pos=0", and it does not change any arrow behaviour
unless the new positioning arguments (which are the same as for deco.text()) are used.

I would say that "pos" is perfect for begin and end arrows, whereas "arclenpos"
is perfect for arrows heads in between.
