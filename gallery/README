PyX gallery

Similar to the PyX example pages the gallery shows you some ready-to-run PyX
code. But whereas the examples try to provide you minimal examples to explain
various features of PyX, in the gallery, we show you some fancy and/or real world
examples. While sometimes you will find some explanations similar to those of
the example pages, a full description of all the details is far out of scope
for the gallery. Still, the shown code might be well suited as a starting point
for your own experiments with PyX.

We encourage you to submit suitable gallery examples via the [PyX mailing lists
http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=45430]. In case the example needs
external data, please try to use a single external data file only. Optionally,
you can include a short description on the specifics of the example, e.g., what
cool feature of PyX it makes use of.
