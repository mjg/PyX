graph.style.arrow seems to allow arbitrary decorations, and the argument
could also be named "decoscale". But there is arrowpos and arrowsize already.

This is just a suggestion, I'm sure there are better ways of doing this.
Note that without this patch, a user would have to supply a decorator
which ignores the size argument that graph.style.arrow stuffs into it
and uses a fixed size instead, which is possible, of course. I do think that
arrow (vector field) plots with variable arrow length and fixed head size
are a common use case, though. In fact, one could argue that arrowscale=0
would be a sensible default.
