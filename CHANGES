TODO:
  - style module:
    - default patterns
    - make dash length available
  - text module:
    - SlantFont & Co support
    - keep an eye on PEP 324 (popen 5): it could make the texrunner much easier
    - messageparser for replaced fontsizes: Warning
    - messageparser for size differences at the end: Warning not Exception
    - messageparser for overfull/underfull vbox/hbox: Warning not Exception
    - newline removal when not disturbing texmessages only
  - graph.graph module
    - common bboxes for different graphs
    - 3d graphs, circular graphs
    - axis painter labelattrs=None + automatic axis partitioning leads to no valid partitioning
  - graph.style and graph.data modules
    - exceptions in drawsymbol & friends...
    - caution: another reorganization round is in progress
      (its goal is to make graph styles combinable which will also
      split up the style code in smaller parts -- those will then be
      easier to substitute by inheritance)
    - fix docu (or code) of gridattrs functionality of axis painters
      (how can one, e.g. draw a grid at the ticks and not at the subticks)
  - graph.data module:
    - use csv module (new in 2.3)
    - Check for "inf" and "nan" in datafiles.
      (When plotted, the graph does not complain, but the postscript will be broken)
  - graph.style module:
    - add styles using curves instead of lines
    - add "steps" style for histogram-like plots
  - canvas module:
    - finish multi page PostScript output
    - contructor should only take a texrunner keyword argument
    - set method???

    - SVG support

    - support modification of existing styles via __call__
  - bbox module:
    - height -> getheight, ...
  - mathtree:
    - might be moved into the graph
    - perform calc by means of Python itself (see eval code in graph.data, but
      we should use compiled code instead of eval)
  - deco module:
    - think hard about different paths in decoratedpath class
  - dvifile module:
    - support single-character mode
  - path module:
    - arclentoparam should raise an exception when the arclen is out of range
    - there are two epsilons related to normpath, one in the normpath and
      one in the subnormpath; while the later seems a clear feature, the first
      might be a misdesign; a solution is still pending ...
  - color module:
    - what should we do for palette when only one entry
  - connector module:
    - is the early conversion with unit.topt unit-modification-save?
  - deformer module:
    - better names for the helper functions ?

0.6 (2004/03/30):
  - graph module:

      small pending issues, but the basic restructuring is done with this release):
      - graph splitted into several modules in pyx/graph and pyx/graph/axis
      - painters are using the new attribute scheme including changeable
        attributes
      - graph styles rewrite
      - graph data rewrite
    - axis zeropath feature has been removed

    - manual line clipping (do not include unneeded line segments when the
      axis range is set manually etc.)
    - automatic file key titles
    - graph.data now also includes the old data module
    - data.list adds (by default) a line number like data.file
      (thus regular columns are counted from 1)

      a list of points and can thus be much more efficient
    - internal methods return coordinates in pts

    - added path.arclength_pt, path.at_pt, path.begin_pt, path.end_pt (and
      correspondingly for normpath)

      normsubpaths which themselves consist of normlines and normcurves This is
      much more convenient for any routines working with normpaths.
    - reversing of closed sub paths does not change the first point of the sub
      path
    - renamed: arclength -> arclen
    - renamed: lentopar -> arclentoparam
    - renamed: glue -> joined
    - normpath now supports join, the in-place version of joined
    - path and normpath method raise exception instead of returning None
      when parameter is out of range

      expects a list of attrs as first argument (defaulting to []) and
      a texrunner as second argument (defaulting to text.defaulttexrunner)
    - set, draw, stroke and fill no longer return self, i.e., the canvas, but None
  - bbox module:
     - added inplace add (__iadd__), enlarge and transform methods
     - callers use inplace add where possible now (yielding a considerable
       speedup)

      the bounding box operations much more efficient.

    - renamed _xxx -> xxx_pt
  - epsfile module:
    - removed showbbox argument of epsfile class
  - text module:
