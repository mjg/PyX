My PIL is at 1.1.7, python is 2.7.

The error log leading up to that is

  File "/home/mjg/src/pyx/pyx/epsfile.py", line 354, in processPDF
    b.processPDF(file, writer, context, registry, bbox)
  File "/home/mjg/src/pyx/pyx/bitmap.py", line 515, in processPDF
    mode, data, alpha, palettemode, palettedata = self.imagedata(False)
  File "/home/mjg/src/pyx/pyx/bitmap.py", line 361, in imagedata
    bands = data.split()
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/PIL/Image.py", line 1497, in split
    if self.im.bands == 1:
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'bands'

In fact, the same problem occurs when inserting PIL images with lazy loading.
One may or may not leave the Image.load() invocation at the user's discretion
in that case. One may actually claim that it's a matter of PIL being too lazy...
