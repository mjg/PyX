    <h1>PyX - Documentation</h1>


    <h2>Examples and gallery</h2>

    <p>For a quick introduction to PyX, we recommend having a look on our <a
    href="examples/index.html">examples</a> page. There you find lots of small
    cookbook-like examples describing how to solve common drawing and plotting
    tasks in PyX. Every example is accompanied by a detailed description of the
    concepts it makes use of. By taking a tour through the examples, you should, thus,
    learn how to effectively use PyX.</p>

    <p>More elaborate PyX drawings together with the corresponding sources can
    be found in the <a href="gallery/index.html">gallery</a>. </p>

    <h2>Manual</h2>

    <p>Detailed information about PyX can be found in the PyX reference manual, which
    is available both as PDF and as online HTML version:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="manual.pdf">reference manual (PDF version)</a></li>
      <li><a href="manual/index.html">online reference manual (HTML version)</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <p>A further resource containing tips and tricks for PyX users is the FAQ
    contributed by Gert-Ludwig Ingold. At the moment, it is only available as PDF:</p>

    <ul>
