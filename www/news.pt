    <dl>
      <dt>2007-10-03: PyX 0.10 released</dt>
      <dd>
        This release adds 3d plotting facilities to PyX using parallel or central
        projection. Two new graph styles grids and surfaces can be used in 3d
        graphs as well as some existing generic graph styles (symbols, lines,
        errorbars etc.). Several new examples, various other improvements
        requested by PyX users and some bugfixes complete this release.
      </dd>
      <dt>2006-09-14: Talk about Type1 fonts and PyX in Rosenheim</dt>
      <dd>
        A talk about Type1 fonts and PyX was presented at the
        <a href="http://www.dante.de/dante/events/mv35/">fall meeting</a> of the <a href="http://www.dante.de/dante/events/mv35/">German Speaking TeX User Group DANTE e.V.</a> (September 14th and 15th, Rosenheim).
        The presentation is available in
        <a href="presentation_dantemv35_de.pdf">German (pdf, 19 pages, 226 KB)</a> and
        in a crude <a href="presentation_dantemv35_en.pdf">english translation</a>.
      </dd>
      <dt>2006-09-11: First public version of PyXPlot released</dt>
      <dd>
        Dominic Ford released the first public version of <a
        href="http://www.pyxplot.org.uk/">PyXPlot</a>, which provides a
        Gnuplot-style interface to PyX. PyXPlot already supports a large subset
        of Gnuplot's original functionality, always combined with the
        high-quality output of PyX.
      </dd>
      <dt>2006-05-24: PyX 0.9 released</dt>
      <dd>
        This release features a new set of deformers for path manipulations
        like smoothing, shifting, etc. A new set of extensively documented
        examples describing various aspects of PyX in a cookbook-like fashion
        have been written. Type 1 font-stripping is now handled by a newly
        written Python module. The evaluation of functions for graph plotting
        is now left to Python. Thereby some obscure data manipulation could be
        removed from the bar style for handling of nested bar graphs.
        Transparency is now supported for PDF output. Many more small
        improvements and bug fixes top off this release.
      </dd>
      <dt>2006-01-20: New PyX tutorial for Gnuplot users</dt>
      <dd>
        Titus Winters wrote a very nice <a href="http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~titus/pyxTutorial/">tutorial</a>
        explaining the basics of PyX's graph-plotting facilities for users familiar with Gnuplot.
      </dd>
      <dt>2005-08-13: PyX 0.8.1 released</dt>
      <dd>
        This release fixes some bugs in the path module and the output of decorated
        paths. The fallback for kpathsea was considerably improved in speed (it was
        unintensionally slowed down in 0.8). The inclusion of the bounding box
        information in PS and PDF files is now optional. It is suppressed by default
        when a paperformat is specified. A new path example completes the release.
      </dd>
      <dt>2005-07-13: PyX 0.8 released</dt>
      <dd>
        PyX now supports PDF output and also the generation of multi-page PS/PDF
        documents. The internals of the path system have been cleaned up and the
        external interface has been streamlined. The axis data handling of the graph
        component has undergone a major revision. Many other improvements and bug fixes
        are included in this release.
      </dd>
      <dt>2004-12-15: PyX 0.7.1 released</dt>
      <dd>
        This release fixes some bugs in the graph system, the canvas module and
        the kpsewhich support. The tipa package is no longer required to build
        the FAQ. The index files to sort the examples are now included in the
        distribution. Two new examples complete this maintenance release.
      </dd>
      <dt>2004-10-29: PyX presentation in Hannover</dt>
      <dd>
        PyX was presented at the
        <a href="http://www.dante.de/dante/events/mv31/">fall meeting of the German Speaking TeX User Group DANTE e.V. (October 29nd to 30th, Hannover)</a>.
        The presentation is available in
        <a href="presentation_dantemv31_de.pdf">German (pdf, 16 Pages, 346 KB)</a> only.
      </dd>
      <dt>2004-10-21: PyX 0.7 released</dt>
      <dd>
        This release adds support for the inclusion of bitmaps. The internals of the path system
        have undergone a major revision and cleanup. The handling of short
        path elements has been enhanced considerably to prevent numerical
        instabilities. The data and style handling in the graph system has been
        completely reorganized. It is now possible to combine several graph
        styles within a single plot instruction.
      </dd>
      <dt>2004-04-27: PyX 0.6.3 released</dt>
      <dd>
        PyX 0.6.3 contains a few bug fixes and includes the source for the FAQ
        and the manual as requested by a package maintainer.
      </dd>
      <dt>2004-04-07: PyX 0.6.2 released</dt>
      <dd>
        PyX 0.6.2 fixes a few bugs in the graph system.
      </dd>
      <dt>2004-03-31: PyX 0.6.1 released</dt>
      <dd>
        PyX 0.6.1 fixes a brown paper bag bug in the distribtion which missed
        to contain the new directories for the graph and the axis system.
      </dd>
      <dt>2004-03-30: PyX 0.6 released</dt>
      <dd>
        This release further improves the internal design and visible interfaces
        of PyX. The path system has undergone a major revision and cleanup.
        The graph module has been split into several smaller modules,
        reflecting its component architecture. Moreover, PyX now makes use of
        the attribute system introduced in the previous release. Graph styles
        and data handling have been largely revised. Major parts of the
        documentation have been rewritten and are now based on the standard
        Python documentation style. Bug-fixes and speed improvements complete
        this release.
