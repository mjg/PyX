The patch is against r3425, sorry for not being on py 3 yet.

Simple reproducer:

from pyx import *

gridpainter = graph.axis.painter.regular(gridattrs=[])
gridaxis = graph.axis.linear(painter=gridpainter)
g=graph.graphxy(width=6, x=gridaxis, y=gridaxis, xaxisat=0, yaxisat=0)
g.plot(graph.data.function("y(x)=x*x", min=-1, max=1))
g.writePDFfile()
