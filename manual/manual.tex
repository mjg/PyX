\begin{abstract}
\noindent
\PyX{} is a Python package to create encapsulated PostScript figures. It
provides classes and methods to access basic PostScript functionality
at an abstract level. At the same time the emerging structures are
very convenient to produce all kinds of drawings in a non-interactive
way. In combination with the Python language itself the user can just
code any complexity of the figure wanted. Additionally an
\TeX{}/\LaTeX{} interface enables one to use the famous high quality
typesetting within the figures.

A major part of \PyX{} on top of the already described basis is the
provision of high level functionality for complex tasks like 2d plots
in publication-ready quality.
