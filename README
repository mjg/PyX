                      PyX - Python graphics package
                      =============================

PyX is a Python package to create encapsulated PostScript figures. It provides
classes and methods to access basic PostScript functionality at an abstract
level. At the same time the emerging structures are very convenient to produce
all kinds of drawings in a non-interactive way. In combination with the Python
language itself the user can just code any complexity of the figure wanted.
Additionally an TeX/LaTeX interface enables one to use the famous high quality
typesetting within the figures.

A major part of PyX on top of the already described basis is the provision of
high level functionality for complex tasks like 2d plots in publication-ready
quality.
