In fact, the version in r3201 also leaves an open file handle around which
is not used later on (the seek() is superfluous).

We cannot reuse it in PSwriter() since that may be called more than once,
but closes the handle.

With the current design of filelocator (returning fd's), I think there are only
two possibilities:

* Multiple filelocator calls (like in my submission). This closes fds properly.
  I may have missed a close(), though: linefilereader.close() is defined but never
  used (neither before nor after these patches).

* Store the fd in self.file and don't close it.

At least with r3201+this fix (or the original submission) it works. But we should
probably close instead of seek after _readbb.
